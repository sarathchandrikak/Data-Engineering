# BIG QUERY



## Big Query Best Practice 

Best practices are mostly focused on cost reduction or performance improvement

#### Steps to consider for cost reduction
ğŸ”¹ Avoid Select * and instead specify column name, this is because of the columnar architecture of Big Query \
ğŸ”¹ Clustering and Partitioning help in reducing cost \
ğŸ”¹ Materialize query into different stages 

#### Steps to consider for performance imporvement 
ğŸ”¹ Filter on partitioned/cluster column \
ğŸ”¹ Denormalize the data \
ğŸ”¹ Reduce data before using a join \
ğŸ”¹ Do not treat WITH clauses as prepared statements \
ğŸ”¹ Avoid Overshading tables 

#### General Considerations
ğŸ”¹ Avoid using javascript in user defined functions \
ğŸ”¹ Use approximate aggregation functions (HyperLogLog++) \
ğŸ”¹ Place the table with largest rows as the first one while joining 


## Big Query Internals 

ğŸ”¹ Big Query stores the data in Colossus - a columnar storage which is very cheap \
ğŸ”¹ Also since Big Query is separate from compute, costs are minimal \
ğŸ”¹ Most cost occured is during the read/ executing the query \
ğŸ”¹ Jupiter Network is inside Big Query data centers and provides 1TB/s speed and communicate without any delays \
ğŸ”¹ Distribution of workers and dividing the query into smaller chunks help in fast fetching/executing of the data
